# 🏗️ Module 11 Mini-Project: Add Routes to Existing Application

In this mini-project, you will work with a group to add routes to an existing application. You will create one wildcard route for serving up a 404 page, as well as a diagnostics route for logging failed form validation.

* As a developer, I want to be able to add routes to an existing application.

* As a developer, I want to serve up a custom 404 page when the requested resource doesn't exist.

* As a developer, I want to log usage statistics from users of my site.

* As a developer, I want to be able to deploy my apps to Heroku.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have deployed the finished application to Heroku.
